# Finances
  Finances is a project that allows you to keep up with your finances and investments. Here you can have full control over your spendings and on the profit from the investments. This project data is stored into firebase/firestore. For not causing an overflow of transactions being read and written, I have implemented AsyncStorage with Firestore, reducing the amount of reads significantly.
